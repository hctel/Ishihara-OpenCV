# Ishihara-OpenCV
This repository was created as my 2025 end-of-year project for the ECAM's Computer Vision II course.

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>This projects uses and requires the tesseract-ocr program to convert images into text. It should be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/download/5.5.0/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.5.0.20241111.exe) and installed in C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\.

All Python libraries are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), ready to be passed into pip.

The file to be run is `Runner.py`.

## User manual
Firstly open a command prompt inside the folder containing the project.

You need to install the dependancies first. Python libraries can be installed by running `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in a command prompt.

To start the program, type `py Runner.py`.

To capture and process a frame, simply press the spacebar and wait.

## Report
The project report is both available in markdown ([report.md](report.md)) and as a PDF file ([report.pdf](report.pdf)).
