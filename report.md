# Intro
This project takes place into the Computer Vision II course given at the ECAM, as the end-of-year assessment. Its goal was to implement the different skills learned through the course into a complex computer vision software.

This report focuses on the implementation of a software designed to cheat the Ishihara test, aimed to detect colour blindness.
